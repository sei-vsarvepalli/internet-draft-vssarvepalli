                  IP Encapsulation within IP Protocol
                     draft-ip-in-ip-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the [IP-in-IP] that specifies a method by which
   an IP datagram may be encapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP
   datagram with more detailed Security Considerations.  Encapsulation
   is suggested as a means to alter the normal IP routing for datagrams,
   by delivering them to an intermediate destination that would
   otherwise not be selected by the (network part of the) IP Destination
   Address field in the original IP header.  Encapsulation may serve a
   variety of purposes, such as delivery of a datagram to a mobile node
   using Mobile IP.
